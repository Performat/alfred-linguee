# alfred-linguee
An Alfred workflow that helps you faster translate phrases in Linguee.

Features autocomplete, relying on Google Suggest.

## How-to:
The scheme of the query is very simple and uses the following pattern:

`ling <from language ISO 639-1 code><to language ISO 639-1 code> <phrase to translate>`

Which gives us in the real world:

`ling fren le meilleur des deux mondes`

###Note:
* Please keep in mind that the origin and destination languages are mandatory for now and to omit them would lead to weird results.
* The order of the ISO codes has no incidence on the translation as Linguee automatically finds out about the origin and destination languages.
