# alfred-linguee
A workflow to help you to faster translate stuff in Linguee using Alfred.

## How-to:
The scheme of the query is very simple and uses the following pattern:

`ling <phrase to translate>  <from language ISO 639-1 code><to language ISO 639-1 code>`

Which gives us in the real world:

`ling le meilleur des deux mondes fren`

###Note:
* Please keep in mind that the origin and destination languages are mandatory for now and to omit them would lead to weird results.
* The order of the ISO codes has no incidence on the translation as Linguee automatically finds out about the origin and destination languages.
